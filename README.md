# OpenCV
Test projects with implementation of OpenCV on Python
Some sample outputs in Outputs Folder
i. cam_facedetect: Live Face Detection using Haar Cascade Algorithm. 
ii. cam_canny: Live multicoloured contour lines detection.
iii.cam_face_recog: first takes (frame by frame) webcam input and trains a recognition model on that input sample on LBPH Algorithm. Then reconises the presence of that face in real time. 
Some basic graphic code also present.
